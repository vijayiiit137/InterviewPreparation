(1)Difference Between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java?
(2)Method overriding code?
(3)o/p :
class A {

A() {

}


public void checkFunctionality() {
sysout("in class A")
}


}

class B extends A {
B() {

}

protected void checkFunctionality() {
sysout("in class B")
}

}
(4)Diff between Aggragation,Composition,Association in java?
Associatiom reprsents the relationship between 2 classes.It can be uni directional(one way) or bidirectional(two way)
unidirectional:
Customer places orders
Bidirectional:A is married to A,B is married to A
Aggregation: In Aggregation the dependent object is standalone and can exist even if the object of owing class is dead.
2 Objects Having weak relationship.one object can exist without another Object.
Example : Car and Wheel
		  Explanation : Wheel can be existed even if car is not available, Because this can be fit for other vehicles or other cars.
		  Company and Employee
		  Employee can be existed even if the company closed.
		  Driver and car
		  Team and Player
		  
Composition:In composition the object of class is owned by the object of its owing class cannot live on its own.
Tight coupinig between 2 classes.Both Objects Cannot exist independently.
Example : Car and Specific Engine
Specific Engine will not be available if car is destroyed.
Simple Rule to Remember:
A "owns" B = Composition : B has no meaning or purpose in the system without A.
A "uses" B = Aggregation : B exists Independently(conceptually) from A
(5)Diff between Linked List and ArrayList in java?
(6)Employee having salary and Age
I inserted employeed object inside linkedList
write code for emp salaryhaving > 500

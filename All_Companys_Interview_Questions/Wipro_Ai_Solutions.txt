There was a group of 41 Jewish soldiers surrounded by Roman army, and they didn't want to get caught. So, they sat down in a circle and came up with an algorithm. Everybody had a sword, and starting from person #1 in the circle, everybody will kill the next living person on the left. So, #1 will kill #2. #3 will kill #4, #5 will kill #6 and so on. The last living person will have to commit suicide to avoid getting caught by Romans.

The soldier called Josephus preferred to be caught over committing suicide. So, in the group of 41 soldiers, he chose the location where he will be the last person living.

Write a program to figure out, in a group of given N people, where should Josephus sit to live at the end of all internal killing.

There is a mathematical solution to this problem. But, your program should use the brut force method to find the position. The output of the program may look like this:

Solving Josephus problem for 5 soldiers:
1 kills 2
3 kills 4
5 kills 1
3 kills 5
Josephus should sit on position# 3

Write code in your favoruite programming language to print the "Van Eck Sequence" for the first 100 positions.

Sequence is defined as below:

You start with number 0 at the first position.
For the next number, if you have seen the number at current position before, the next number is the distance between current position and the position where you saw this number before.
If you haven't seen this number before, print 0.
So, you start with 0. You haven't seen 0 before, so next number is also 0. But, now the next number is 1 -- because you saw 0 at position 1 and position 2. You haven't seen 1 before, so next number is 0. You saw 0 at position 2 and position 4, so the next number is 2. And so on...

0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 2, 6, 5, 4, 0, 5, 3, 0, 3, 2, 9, 0, 4, 9, 3, 6, 14, 0, 6, 3, 5, 15, 0,...

A company is repainting its office and would like to choose colors that
work well together. They are presented with several various-priced
color options presented in a specific order so that each color
complements the surrounding colors. The company has a limited
budget and would like to select the greatest number of consecutive
colors that fit within this budget. Given the prices of the colors and the
company's budget, what is the maximum number of colors that can be
purchased for this repainting project?
prices = [2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1]
money = 7
